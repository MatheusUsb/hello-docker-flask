# Docker Hello, World!

Docker is a platform as a service (PaaS) product that utilizes OS-level virtualization to package software into containers. These containers are self-contained units that include all the necessary software, libraries, and configuration files. They are isolated from each other and can communicate through defined channels.

Flask is a lightweight web framework written in Python. It is considered a microframework as it does not require specific tools or libraries. Flask does not provide built-in features like database abstraction or form validation, but it supports extensions that can enhance its functionality.
